In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fnâ€Š.
The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the sequence
from 1 and 1 or sometimes (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2. Starting from 0 and 1, the sequence begins
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ....
The Fibonacci numbers were first described in Indian mathematics as early as 200 BC
in work by Pingala on enumerating possible patterns of Sanskrit poetry formed from syllables of two lengths.
They are named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, also known
as Fibonacci, who introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics in his 1202 book Liber Abaci.
